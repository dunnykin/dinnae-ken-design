<h1 class="page-title">Who am I?</h1>
<section class="about-wrapper">
    <p class="about-intro">My name is JAMIE MORRISON and I am the creator of DINNAE KEN GAMES, DINNAE KEN DESIGN and DINNAE KEN 3D. These areas cover the breadth of my work, the best of which combines all three.</p>

    <p class="about-chunk"><span class="about-heading">DINNAE KEN GAMES</span>
    <br>Game development, predominantly for PC. Whilst my main focus is on Unity 3D and C#, I also have experience developing other types of games using Adobe Animate, Game  Maker Studio and more.</p>

    <p class="about-chunk"><span class="about-heading">DINNAE KEN DESIGN</span>
    <br>In the course of earning my degree, I have developed skills in many areas such as vector and bitmap graphic design, website and app design, video production and 2D animation.</p>

    <p class="about-chunk"><span class="about-heading">DINNAE KEN 3D</span>
    <br>I have been developing my 3D skillset through the creation of models and animations, mainly using 3DS Max, however I have begun to make the switch to Blender, and am now facing the task of transferring skills into a different piece of software and managing a new UI.</p>

    <p class="about-me"><span class="about-heading">A LITTLE BIT ABOUT ME</span>
    <br>I am an avid PC gamer, so when Iâ€™m not developing games I am likely playing them. I also have qualificaitons in acting & performance and have even tried my hand at stand-up comedy, giving me the confidence to perform in front of the camera as well as behind it.</p>
